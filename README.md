# Bloup

Yarn 3 monorepo sample with
- NestJS backend - mongoDB, typeORM, graphQL
- React frontend - graphQL queries

## Dev environment

This repo is made to be used with [VSCode Remote-Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) which setup a Docker container with a fully controlled dev environment (including database and VSCode itself, all in a Linux distro).

### Dev in Windows OS

On Windows it is recommended to use [Windows WSL with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/#develop-with-docker-and-wsl-2) which allow to work on an optimized Linux VM. Using VSCode Remote-Containers with them gives the best dev experience in this OS.
